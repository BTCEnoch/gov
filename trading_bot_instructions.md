Me: Create a Python script that continuously monitors newly listed Solana tokens on DexScreener. For each token, collect price, liquidity, volume, market cap and pair creation time
Grok:
Me: Add filters to exclude tokens from known rug-pull devs. Support token and creator blacklists via a config file
Grok:
Me: Enhance the script to detect tokens with abnormal volume patterns. If volume spikes look artificial or liquidity is mismatched, flag the token as fake and skip any further processing
Grok:
Me: Integrate the bot with Telegram using a webhook. Once a token passes all filters, auto-execute a trade and send a buy or sell notification instantly via a selected Telegram bot
Grok:
Me: For every detected Solana token, run a Rugcheck scan. If the token is not marked as 'Good', skip it. Also, avoid tokens tied to contract bundles or proxy deployments
Grok:
Me: Combine all previous steps into one Python bot: monitor new Solana tokens, apply filters, check safety and auto-trade with Telegram alerts. Use a single config file for settings
