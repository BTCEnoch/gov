  "category": "science",
  "overview": "Greek Mythology is a rich body of ancient narratives concerning gods, goddesses, heroes, monsters, and rituals that explain the origins of the world, natural phenomena, and human customs, serving as the foundation for ancient Greek religion and influencing Western culture profoundly.",

  "historical_context": "Greek mythology originated in the Bronze Age with Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations (c. 2200–1100 BCE), evolving through oral traditions. It crystallized in the Archaic period (c. 800–500 BCE) via epic poems like Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and Hesiod's Theogony. Myths were preserved in literature, art, and artifacts, adapting through Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman eras. Suppressed by Christianity but revived in the Renaissance, it persists in modern scholarship and culture.",

    {
      "name": "Anthropomorphism of Deities",
      "description": "Gods depicted with human forms, emotions, and flaws, interacting with mortals in a shared cosmos. This principle distinguishes Greek mythology from other ancient traditions by making divine beings relatable and psychologically complex. The gods experience jealousy, love, anger, and pride, creating narratives that explore human nature through divine metaphor. This anthropomorphic approach allows for moral and ethical lessons while maintaining the gods' supernatural power and authority.",
