  "tradition_name": "Hermetic Qabalah",
  "category": "magick_systems",
  "overview": "Hermetic Qabalah is a Western esoteric tradition that synthesizes Jewish Kabbalah with Hermetic philosophy, alchemy, astrology, and ceremonial magic, using the Tree of Life as a map for spiritual ascent, divine emanations, and magical operations to achieve union with the divine.",
  
  "historical_context": "Hermetic Qabalah emerged during the Renaissance, blending Christian Cabala with Hermeticism. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola promoted syncretism in the 15th century. Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa integrated it into occult philosophy in the 16th century. Eliphas Levi linked it to Tarot in the 19th century. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn formalized it in the late 19th century, fusing it with Enochian and Eastern elements. Aleister Crowley adapted it for Thelema in the 20th century, influencing modern occultism through groups like O.T.O. and A∴A∴.",

      "description": "A diagram of 10 Sephiroth and 22 paths representing divine emanations and the structure of the universe. The Tree of Life serves as both a map of consciousness and a practical tool for magical work, showing how divine energy flows from the infinite source (Ain Soph Aur) through various levels of manifestation down to the material world. Each Sephirah represents a different aspect of divine emanation and human experience, connected by paths that correspond to the Hebrew alphabet and various symbolic systems.",

This principle explains how the infinite divine essence becomes manifest in increasingly dense forms, with each world representing a different level of reality and consciousness.
