  "overview": "The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is a late 19th-century occult society dedicated to the study and practice of metaphysics, theurgy, and spiritual development, integrating Hermetic Qabalah, alchemy, astrology, tarot, and ceremonial magic to achieve enlightenment and mastery over natural forces.",
  
  "historical_context": "Founded in 1888 in London by William Wynn Westcott, William Robert Woodman, and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn emerged from Rosicrucian and Masonic influences, based on deciphered Cipher Manuscripts. It operated with an Outer Order for foundational teachings and an Inner Order for advanced magic. Internal schisms in 1900 led to factions like Alpha et Omega and Stella Matutina. The order declined by the 1930s but was revived through publications by Israel Regardie and influences modern occultism, Wicca, and Thelema.",
