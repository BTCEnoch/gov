  "overview": "Astrology is an ancient divinatory system that interprets the positions and movements of celestial bodies to understand human affairs, personality, and events. It combines astronomy with symbolic interpretation, viewing the cosmos as interconnected with earthly life, and serves as a tool for self-reflection, prediction, and guidance across cultures.",
  "historical_context": "Astrology originated in Mesopotamia around 2000 BCE, with Babylonian priests tracking planetary movements for omens. It spread to ancient Egypt and Greece, where Hellenistic astrologers like Ptolemy systematized it in the 2nd century AD. During the Islamic Golden Age (8th-13th centuries), scholars such as Al-Biruni advanced it. Medieval Europe integrated it with Christianity, though it faced Church opposition. The Renaissance revived it through figures like Kepler. Modern astrology evolved in the 20th century with psychological approaches by Alan Leo and Dane Rudhyar. Parallel traditions include Vedic (Jyotisha) in India and Chinese astrology.",

      "description": "The twelve zodiac signs (Aries through Pisces) represent archetypal energies and personality patterns that influence human behavior and cosmic cycles. Each sign embodies specific qualities derived from its element (fire, earth, air, water) and modality (cardinal, fixed, mutable). Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) represent action and inspiration; earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) embody practicality and material focus; air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) govern communication and ideas; water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) rule emotions and intuition. The modalities describe how energy is expressed: cardinal signs initiate, fixed signs sustain, and mutable signs adapt.",
