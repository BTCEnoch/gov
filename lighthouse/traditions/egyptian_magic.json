  "overview": "Egyptian Magic, known as Heka, is an ancient spiritual system where magic is a primordial force used by gods and humans to create, protect, and influence reality. It integrates rituals, incantations, amulets, and symbolic actions to maintain cosmic order (Ma'at), blending seamlessly with religion and daily life.",

  "historical_context": "Egyptian Magic originated in predynastic times (c. 6000–3150 BCE), formalized during the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) with Pyramid Texts. It evolved through Middle and New Kingdoms, incorporating personal and state rituals. Priests in temple libraries preserved knowledge, which disseminated to common people. Declined post-Roman conquest but influenced later occult traditions like Hermeticism. Revived in modern esotericism via Egyptology in the 19th century.",

      "name": "Heka as Primordial Force",
      "description": "Magic (heka) is understood as the creative energy used by gods to form the universe, accessible to humans for manifestation and transformation. This principle establishes magic not as supernatural intervention but as a fundamental force of nature, as essential as gravity or electromagnetism. Heka is both the power itself and the god who personifies it, representing the divine creative principle that brings order from chaos. Practitioners understand that by aligning with heka, they participate in the ongoing creation and maintenance of reality, working in harmony with the cosmic forces that sustain existence.",

This principle operates on the understanding that like affects like, and that symbolic actions can influence their real-world counterparts through magical sympathy.
