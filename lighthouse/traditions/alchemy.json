  "name": "Alchemy",
  "description": "Alchemy is an ancient branch of natural philosophy and proto-scientific tradition practiced across multiple civilizations, focusing on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, the discovery of a universal elixir for immortality and health, and the spiritual perfection of the practitioner. It synthesizes elements of chemistry, mysticism, and philosophy, serving as a precursor to modern science while preserving esoteric wisdom.",
  "historical_overview": "Alchemy's origins trace back to Hellenistic Egypt around the 1st-3rd centuries AD, blending Egyptian metallurgical practices with Greek philosophy. It flourished in the Islamic Golden Age (8th-13th centuries), where scholars like Jābir ibn Hayyān systematized it. In medieval Europe (12th-17th centuries), it was pursued by figures like Paracelsus and Newton, evolving into chemistry during the Scientific Revolution. Parallel traditions existed in China (focused on elixirs of immortality) and India (rasayana for mercury-based medicines).",
