  "category": "philosophy",
  "overview": "Ancient religious movement emphasizing gnosis (esoteric knowledge) as the path to salvation, viewing the material world as flawed and created by a lesser demiurge, with humans containing a divine spark that can be awakened for liberation from earthly bondage.",
  
  "historical_context": "Gnosticism emerged in the 1st-2nd centuries AD, influenced by Jewish, Christian, Hellenistic, and Platonic thought, flourishing in the Mediterranean region. Denounced as heresy by early Church Fathers like Irenaeus, it was largely suppressed by the 4th century, with texts destroyed. Rediscovered through the Nag Hammadi library in 1945, revealing diverse sects like Sethians and Valentinians. Influences persisted in medieval groups like Cathars and Bogomils, and modern revivals in esoteric traditions.",
  
  "core_principles": [
    {
      "name": "Gnosis as Salvation",
      "description": "Esoteric knowledge (gnosis) awakens the divine spark within, leading to spiritual liberation beyond faith or rituals. This principle emphasizes direct, experiential knowledge of the divine rather than belief or adherence to external authority. Gnosis is understood as an inner illumination that reveals the true nature of reality and the practitioner's divine origin, providing the key to escape from the material prison of existence.",

      "description": "Fundamental contrast between the transcendent, good spiritual realm (pleroma) and the flawed, evil material world created by the demiurge (Yaldabaoth). The demiurge is portrayed as a lesser, ignorant deity who fashioned the imperfect cosmos, often depicted as malevolent or blind to the true divine realm.
