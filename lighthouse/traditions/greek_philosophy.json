  "overview": "Greek Philosophy is the foundational intellectual tradition of Western thought, originating in ancient Greece, focusing on rational inquiry into existence, knowledge, ethics, politics, and the natural world, emphasizing logic, debate, and the pursuit of wisdom (sophia) to understand reality and achieve human excellence.",
  
  "historical_context": "Greek Philosophy began in the 6th century BCE with Pre-Socratic thinkers like Thales in Ionia, shifting from mythological to rational explanations of the cosmos. It flourished in Athens during the Classical period (5th-4th centuries BCE) with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Hellenistic schools emerged post-Alexander the Great (4th-1st centuries BCE), including Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Skepticism. Influenced Roman thought and declined with Christianity's rise, but revived in the Renaissance, shaping modern science and philosophy.",
