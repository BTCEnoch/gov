  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered howling pose with head tilted toward lunar geometry, chibi proportions with flowing water-drop shaped head with rippling edges and construction paper layers suggesting continuous flow through layered cut-out waves with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating Vesica Piscis, Wave interference patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and Flower of Life emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions with ethereal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor DOAGNIS's profile: 'She who comes without a name', Aethyr ARN, Water element, Tarot The Moon, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Pisces, embodying the essence: 'When DOAGNIS is near, assistance arrives without fanfare an anonymous blessing, answers slipping in ...' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
