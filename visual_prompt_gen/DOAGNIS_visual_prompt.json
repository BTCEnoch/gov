  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered howling pose with head tilted toward lunar geometry, chibi proportions with large translucent patterns potential head with unique Vesica Piscis structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying assistance anonymous patterns. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Vesica Piscis, Wave interference patterns, styled with Dominion guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and neutral grey inspired by blue fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and Vesica Piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions with assistance spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor DOAGNIS's profile: 'She who comes without a name', Aethyr ARN, Water element, Tarot The Moon, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Pisces, embodying the essence: 'When DOAGNIS is near, assistance arrives without fanfare an anonymous blessing, answers slipping in without name or notice.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
