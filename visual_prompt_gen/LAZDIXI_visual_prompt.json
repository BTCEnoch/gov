  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered blessing pose with both hands raised in sacred mudra, chibi proportions with large translucent prismatic geometric head with unique hexagonal water crystal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal water crystal, merkaba, vesica piscis patterns, styled with Dominion guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by nature and neutral grey inspired by silver fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and hexagonal water crystal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor LAZDIXI's profile: 'He who has no supreme name', Aethyr LIT, Water element, Tarot The Hierophant, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Taurus, embodying the essence: 'When LAZDIXI is near, reality feels safeguarded clear boundaries hold firm, keeping the very syntax of existence intact.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
