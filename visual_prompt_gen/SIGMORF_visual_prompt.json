  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered authoritative standing pose with arms crossed over geometric chest piece, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or tetrahedral spike-like projections from the head incorporating tetrahedron, octahedron, stellated polyhedron patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast and neutral grey ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and Star tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with celestial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor SIGMORF's profile: 'He who visits the darkness', Aethyr TAN, Air element, Tarot The Emperor, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'In SIGMORF's presence, fear melts away in steady flame a fearless aura that forges fearless resolve ...' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
