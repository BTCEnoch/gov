  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered howling pose with head tilted toward lunar geometry, chibi proportions with large translucent crystalline organic head with unique crescent structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying intuition gentle. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating crescent, wave, fractal spiral patterns, styled with Throne marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by blue and neutral grey inspired by lunar ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with Zodiac-embroidered robes and stellar alignment vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating dark fabrics with star points, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and crescent emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface combined with star map scroll with intuition spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor OMAGRAP's profile: 'He of lunar knowledge', Aethyr POP, Air element, Tarot The Moon, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Pisces, embodying the essence: 'When OMAGRAP is invoked, intuition moves in gentle cycles the atmosphere invites deep reflection as patterns repeat like comforting lunar phases.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
