  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered cosmic dancing pose within geometric mandala circle, chibi proportions with large prismatic geometric fluid head with unique fractal tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying eternal time. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal tetrahedron, merkaba star, flower of life patterns, styled with Angel guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and neutral grey inspired by wisdom ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with Hexagram-patterned robes and oracle consultant tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating bamboo-woven fabrics, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and fractal tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns combined with bagua mirror with eternal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor YALPAMB's profile: 'He who is the beginning and the end', Aethyr ZEN, Air element, Tarot The World, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Capricorn, embodying the essence: 'In YALPAMB's presence, one senses the eternal cycle turning past and future fold together in a vast calm, revealing the unbroken wholeness of time.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
