  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered authoritative standing pose with arms crossed over geometric chest piece, chibi proportions with large prismatic flame multifaceted head with unique merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying sacred Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating merkaba, flower_of_life, tetractys patterns, styled with Archangel marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by energy and neutral grey inspired by electric angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with Hexagram-patterned robes and oracle consultant tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating bamboo-woven fabrics, elaborate with pulsing Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade combined with Yarrow stalks with sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor VAUAAMP's profile: 'He who initiates action', Aethyr MAZ, Fire element, Tarot The Emperor, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'In VAUAAMP's presence, a first spark of creation sketches sacred angles in living fire one feels the prime mover igniting all beginnings.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
