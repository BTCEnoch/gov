  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered cosmic dancing pose within geometric mandala circle, chibi proportions with large fractal edges shift head with unique Flower of Life structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying cosmic. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Flower of Life, Merkaba, Vesica Piscis patterns, styled with Cherub influences. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast inspired by Electric and neutral grey inspired by blue ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and Flower of Life emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions with cosmic spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor PARAOAN's profile: 'He who has eyes', Aethyr LIN, Spirit (All Elements) element, Tarot The World, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Aquarius, embodying the essence: 'In PARAOAN's presence, the veil of ordinary reality grows thin a mysterious sense of the universal permeates the air, hinting at transcendent truths beyond form.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
