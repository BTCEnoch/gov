  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered forward-leaning pose with hands gripping ethereal reins, chibi proportions with large translucent crystalline geometric head with unique hexagonal wind spiral structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying gentle compassion. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal wind spiral, fractal wave matrices patterns, styled with Principality gentle influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and neutral grey inspired by blue ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with Major/Minor suit robes and tower-structured vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating layered paper-like fabrics, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and hexagonal wind spiral emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions combined with Tarot deck pouch with gentle spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor NABAOMI's profile: 'He who knows pain', Aethyr ZEN, Air element, Tarot The Chariot, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Cancer, embodying the essence: 'In NABAOMI's presence, a gentle cyclone of compassion swirls through hidden heart-chambers old traumas are scoured clean and grief is tempered into quiet, luminous resolve.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
