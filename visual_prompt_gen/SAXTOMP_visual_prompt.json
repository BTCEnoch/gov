  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large multifaceted prismatic flame head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying flame burns. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with Principality flame influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by fire and neutral grey inspired by transformative angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with divine spark tunics and Archon-resistant armored robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating translucent veils for revelation, elaborate with pulsing Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents combined with demiurge-binding chain with flame spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor SAXTOMP's profile: 'She whose name means understanding', Aethyr MAZ, Fire element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'In SAXTOMP's presence, a flame of pure comprehension burns away illusion until only the bone-truth of the cosmos remains.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
