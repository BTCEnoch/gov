  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or hexagonal crystalline appendages like sacred geometry horns incorporating hexagonal, merkaba, flower of life patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with pulsing Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents with celestial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor SAXTOMP's profile: 'She whose name means understanding', Aethyr MAZ, Fire element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'In SAXTOMP's presence, a flame of pure comprehension burns away illusion until only the bone-truth o...'
