  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered crouched binding pose with chains of geometric patterns, chibi proportions with large translucent fluid Hexagonal head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying time still. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, fractal, mobius patterns, styled with Virtue time influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Deep and neutral grey inspired by blue fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with superposition tunics and Wave-particle duality garments with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating fluctuating textures, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns combined with wave function staff with time spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor PACASNA's profile: 'She who is unchanged by time', Aethyr ARN, Water element, Tarot The Devil, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Capricorn, embodying the essence: 'In PACASNA's presence, time itself seems to stand still at an unmoving center a still-point of eternity about which the ages quietly wheel.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
