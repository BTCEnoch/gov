  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large geometric translucent edges head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying perfect. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, dodecahedron, vesica_piscis patterns, styled with Power commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and neutral grey inspired by mercurial ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with wu wei minimalist garments and taiji pattern sashes with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating Natural silk for flow, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals combined with Bagua mirror with perfect spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TOCARZI's profile: 'He of such equality', Aethyr TAN, Air element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'In TOCARZI's presence, all things regain their equilibrium an invisible scale seems to bring every situation into fair and perfect balance.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
