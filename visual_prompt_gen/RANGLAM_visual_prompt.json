  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large geometric translucent angular head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Hexagonal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, fractal, merkaba patterns, styled with Throne marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by wisdom and neutral grey inspired by Shifting structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with Hexagram-patterned robes and oracle consultant tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating bamboo-woven fabrics, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents combined with hexagram coins with Hexagonal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor RANGLAM's profile: 'He who governs his thoughts', Aethyr VTI, Earth element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'As RANGLAM approaches, a monk-like stillness prevails mind and body align under strict self-discipline, and contemplation becomes as natural as breath.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
