  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered cosmic dancing pose within geometric mandala circle, chibi proportions with large translucent wave Sacred head with unique vesica_piscis structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating vesica_piscis, merkaba_spiral patterns, styled with Dominion commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by spiritual and neutral grey fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with horoscope chart capes and Zodiac-embroidered robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating Celestial-patterned velvet, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and vesica_piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions combined with zodiac wheel ring with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor MOLPAND's profile: 'He who recieves men', Aethyr ICH, Water element, Tarot The World, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Aquarius, embodying the essence: 'In MOLPAND's presence, a tranquil harbor opens for the soul a port where journeyman spirits first taste the calm of incarnation.'
