  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered forward-leaning pose with hands gripping ethereal reins, chibi proportions with large dynamic flame crystalline head with unique hexagonal fractal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal fractal, merkaba star, flower of life patterns, styled with Dominion guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by fire and dark grey with high contrast inspired by transformative angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with Wave-particle duality garments and superposition tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating probabilistic patterns on cotton, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and hexagonal fractal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions combined with Quantum bit pendant with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ZAMFRES's profile: 'He who appears when praised', Aethyr ZID, Fire element, Tarot The Chariot, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Cancer, embodying the essence: 'In ZAMFRES's presence, honest praise takes on life genuine gratitude manifests tangible blessings before your eyes.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
