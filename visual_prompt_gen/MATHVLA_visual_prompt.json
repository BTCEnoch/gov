  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered rising pose with arms spread in resurrection gesture, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted solid translucent head with unique octahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying balance. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating octahedron, fractal earth matrix, merkaba patterns, styled with Archangel influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by nature and neutral grey inspired by metallic structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and octahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents with balance spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor MATHVLA's profile: 'He who ends actions', Aethyr ZAA, Earth element, Tarot Judgement, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Scorpio, embodying the essence: 'As MATHVLA approaches, wavering ends at once a decisive finality grips the moment, ensuring all actions reach a firm and resolute conclusion.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
