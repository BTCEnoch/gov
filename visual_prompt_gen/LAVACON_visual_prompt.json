  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large translucent multi-faceted crystalline head with unique tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying fairness Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating tetrahedron, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with Cherub fairness influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by blue and neutral grey inspired by nature ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with Arcana-illustrated cloaks and fool's motley tunic with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating colorful accents on grey base, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface combined with trump symbol brooch with fairness spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor LAVACON's profile: 'The happy one', Aethyr LEA, Air element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'In LAVACON's presence, a warm fairness permeates the air base conditions are kindly uplifted and transmuted as if by a compassionate, solar fire.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
