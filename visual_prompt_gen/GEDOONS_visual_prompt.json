  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose with arms extended in harmonious gesture, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline solid head with unique hexagonal prism structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Hexagonal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal prism, merkaba star, vesica piscis patterns, styled with Archangel marshals influences. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast inspired by Electric and neutral grey inspired by blue angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with divine love sashes and ecstatic dance mantles with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating spinning-friendly cotton, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and hexagonal prism emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents combined with reed flute with Hexagonal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor GEDOONS's profile: 'He who eliminates your name', Aethyr LOE, Fire element, Tarot The Lovers, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Gemini, embodying the essence: 'When GEDOONS is near, identities can be erased like chalk names vanish from celestial rolls to grant the bearer tactical invisibility.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
