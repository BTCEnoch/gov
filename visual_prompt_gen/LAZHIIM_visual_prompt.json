  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered blessing pose with both hands raised in sacred mudra, chibi proportions with large prismatic structured faceted head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Hexagonal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, fractal, nested patterns, styled with Power commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with Zodiac-embroidered robes and horoscope chart capes with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating metallic thread for planets, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals combined with planetary talisman with Hexagonal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor LAZHIIM's profile: 'He who makes use of the day', Aethyr DES, Earth element, Tarot The Hierophant, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Taurus, embodying the essence: 'As LAZHIIM approaches, potential is swiftly seized every opportunity is efficiently utilized, and productivity flows with grounded ease.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
