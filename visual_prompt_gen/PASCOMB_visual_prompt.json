  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large translucent solid sacred head with unique fractal_wave structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying intuition Fractal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal_wave, merkaba_intersection patterns, styled with Cherub hosts influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Azure and neutral grey inspired by Sagittarian fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with fool's motley tunic and tower-structured vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating colorful accents on grey base, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and fractal_wave emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface combined with key of Solomon pendant with intuition spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor PASCOMB's profile: 'He who precedes understanding', Aethyr LIL, Water element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'In PASCOMB's presence, a diamond spark glimmers at the cusp of dawn an intuition before thought, a proto-logos of inspiration.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
