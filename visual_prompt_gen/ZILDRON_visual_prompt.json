  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered dramatic pose with arms raised as if struck by lightning, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or tetrahedral spike-like projections from the head incorporating tetrahedron, fractal spirals, merkaba patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast and neutral grey ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and Flower of Life emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with celestial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ZILDRON's profile: 'He who sets in flight', Aethyr CHR, Air element, Tarot The Tower, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'In ZILDRON's presence, change feels exhilarating and imminent a catalytic force breaks old bonds and...'
