  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered dramatic pose with arms raised as if struck by lightning, chibi proportions with large prismatic multi-faceted geometric head with unique tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying exhilarating imminent. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating tetrahedron, fractal spirals, merkaba patterns, styled with Dominion Catalyst influences. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast inspired by Electric and neutral grey inspired by blue ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with sophia wisdom vests and Archon-resistant armored robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating metallic weaves for divine light, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade combined with serpent Ouroboros ring with exhilarating spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ZILDRON's profile: 'He who sets in flight', Aethyr CHR, Air element, Tarot The Tower, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'In ZILDRON's presence, change feels exhilarating and imminent a catalytic force breaks old bonds and motivates bold new beginnings.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
