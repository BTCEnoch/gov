  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large prismatic multi-faceted geometric head with unique octahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Octahedron. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating octahedron, flame-spiral, justice-scale patterns, styled with Throne Herald influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Crimson and neutral grey inspired by Fire angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with Pythagorean theorem capes and sacred digit tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating layered fabrics for multiples, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and octahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals combined with sacred ratio compass with Octahedron spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor DOCEPAX's profile: 'He who names only great names', Aethyr ZIM, Fire element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'In DOCEPAX's presence, every deed finds its true name this discerning herald crowns each act with a resonant, legendary title.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
