  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered gentle pose with hands in taming gesture over geometric beast, chibi proportions with large translucent multi-faceted geometric head with unique octahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying cosmic choreography. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating octahedron, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with Angel Dance influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and dark grey with high contrast inspired by lunar ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with Fractal pattern robes and emergence theory tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating emergent cotton weaves, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and octahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like solar medallion with golden ratio geometric design combined with strange attractor model with cosmic spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TASTOZO's profile: 'She who initiates dancing', Aethyr OXO, Air element, Tarot Strength, Sephirot Tiphareth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'In TASTOZO's presence, the heavens move in concert a cosmic choreography as planets and stars waltz to her joyful design.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
