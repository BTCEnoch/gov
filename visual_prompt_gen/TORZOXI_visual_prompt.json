The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered blessing pose with both hands raised in sacred mudra, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating octahedron, merkaba, flower of life patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and dark grey with high contrast ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and dodecahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals with celestial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TORZOXI's profile: 'She who rises up in strength', Aethyr POP, Air element, Tarot The Hierophant, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Taurus, embodying the essence: 'In TORZOXI's presence, courage surges anew the atmosphere brims with resilient valor, empowering the...'
