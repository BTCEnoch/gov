  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered gentle pose with hands in taming gesture over geometric beast, chibi proportions with large geometric Crystalline fractal head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying compassion benevolent. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, merkaba, flower_of_life patterns, styled with Principality compassion influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Emerald and neutral grey inspired by energy structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with simple woolen robes and divine love sashes with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating embroidered silk with Arabic calligraphy, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like solar medallion with golden ratio geometric design combined with Prayer beads (misbaha) with compassion spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor VASTRIM's profile: 'He who is merciful', Aethyr RII, Earth element, Tarot Strength, Sephirot Tiphareth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'As VASTRIM approaches, kindness spreads like a soft light anger and hurt melt away in the glow of compassion, and a benevolent forgiveness fills the air.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
