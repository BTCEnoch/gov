  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted geometric angular head with unique dodecahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying insight cosmic. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating dodecahedron, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with insight influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by nature and neutral grey inspired by wisdom structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and dodecahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface with insight spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ODRAXTI's profile: 'He who opens up the east', Aethyr RII, Earth element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'In ODRAXTI's presence, the morning of insight dawns a guiding Eastern star that cuts through confusion with the sharp logic of truth.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
