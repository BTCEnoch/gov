  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered transformative striding pose with scythe-like geometric tool, chibi proportions with large prismatic multi-faceted solid head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, merkaba, flower_of_life patterns, styled with Throne commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Crimson and neutral grey inspired by shifting angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with pleroma-inspired capes and Archon-resistant armored robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating dark fabrics with hidden symbols, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade combined with serpent Ouroboros ring with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ASPIAON's profile: 'She who precedes inner truth', Aethyr DEO, Fire element, Tarot Death, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Scorpio, embodying the essence: 'When ASPIAON stands before you, rightful order asserts itself motives are tested in a fiery tribunal of truth.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
