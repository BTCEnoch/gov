  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large prismatic solid geometric head with unique merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying interconnectedness. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating merkaba, flower_of_life, vesica_piscis patterns, styled with Cherub influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by silver and neutral grey transcendent layered robes combining all elemental patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for unity and synthesis, elaborate with shifting Spirit element pentagram motifs and unifying patterns and merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals with interconnectedness spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rainbow essence wisps and transcendent particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor COMANAN's profile: 'He who knows how to manifest', Aethyr ZAX, Spirit element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'In COMANAN's presence, seeds of possibility stir to life drawing spirit into leaf and legend in a quiet alchemy of growth.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
