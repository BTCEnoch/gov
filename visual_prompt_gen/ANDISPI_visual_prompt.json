  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered transformative striding pose with scythe-like geometric tool, chibi proportions with large shift geometric interconnectedness head with unique fractal wave forms structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying interconnectedness. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal wave forms, hexagonal water crystals patterns, styled with guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by silver and neutral grey inspired by blue fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and fractal wave forms emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with interconnectedness spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ANDISPI's profile: 'He who binds into obedience', Aethyr ZOM, Water element, Tarot Death, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Scorpio, embodying the essence: 'When ANDISPI is near, a profound covenant fills the space a resonant vow knitting separate wills into living harmony.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
