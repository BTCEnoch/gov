  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered howling pose with head tilted toward lunar geometry, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted prismatic solid head with unique octahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying sacred darkness. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating octahedron, crescent, wave spiral patterns, styled with Virtue sacred influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by blue and neutral grey inspired by lunar structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with planetary symbol tunics and Zodiac-embroidered robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating metallic thread for planets, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and octahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions combined with planetary talisman with sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor NIGRANA's profile: 'He who governs the 28 days of the moon', Aethyr DES, Earth element, Tarot The Moon, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Pisces, embodying the essence: 'In NIGRANA's presence, the world moves to a sacred rhythm half light, half darkness, each cycle intuitive and measured as if drawn by lunar tides at the edge of awareness.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
