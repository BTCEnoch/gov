  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered seated meditation pose with hands resting on sacred geometry, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating octahedron, merkaba, flower of life patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and Vesica Piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions with elemental spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor CRPANIB's profile: 'He who destroys speech', Aethyr ZAA, Earth element, Tarot The High Priestess, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Cancer, embodying the essence: 'In CRPANIB's presence, even silence speaks volumes an unseen undercurrent passes through the hush, h...'
