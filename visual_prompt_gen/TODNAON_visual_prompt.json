  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered crouched binding pose with chains of geometric patterns, chibi proportions with large prismatic flame crystalline head with unique fractal hexagram structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal hexagram, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with Virtue influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by crimson and dark grey with high contrast inspired by fire angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with horoscope chart capes and stellar alignment vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating flowing silk for cosmic movement, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and fractal hexagram emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns combined with zodiac wheel ring with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TODNAON's profile: 'He who is and will be', Aethyr ZID, Fire element, Tarot The Devil, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Capricorn, embodying the essence: 'In TODNAON's presence, surfaces become mirrors of destiny reflections of the future shift and reveal themselves.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
