  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered crouched binding pose with chains of geometric patterns, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating fractal hexagram, merkaba, flower of life patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and dark grey with high contrast angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and stellated octahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns with primordial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TODNAON's profile: 'He who is and will be', Aethyr ZID, Fire element, Tarot The Devil, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Capricorn, embodying the essence: 'In TODNAON's presence, surfaces become mirrors of destiny reflections of the future shift and reveal...' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
