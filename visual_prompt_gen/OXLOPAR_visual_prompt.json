  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered transformative striding pose with scythe-like geometric tool, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted geometric crystalline head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Hexagonal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, fractal, sacred mountain patterns, styled with Throne marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by emerald and neutral grey structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with Hexagonal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor OXLOPAR's profile: 'He who has them in his hands', Aethyr BAG, Earth element, Tarot Death, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Scorpio, embodying the essence: 'As OXLOPAR approaches, a protective hold grips the environment like an invisible hand preventing any straying, it is both sheltering and unyieldingly firm.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
