  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large translucent prismatic interconnected head with unique Merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying balanced benevolent. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Merkaba, Flower of Life, Vesica Piscis patterns, styled with Virtue Winds influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and neutral grey inspired by lunar ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with Flowing Taoist priest robes and taiji pattern sashes with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating breathable linen suggesting qi movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and Merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals combined with yin-yang pendant with balanced spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor AYDROPT's profile: 'She who sees us with equality', Aethyr TAN, Air element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'In AYDROPT's presence, the atmosphere feels balanced and benevolent a gentle wind of fairness that carries compassion and clears all prejudice.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
