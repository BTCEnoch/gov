  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large multifaceted prismatic crystalline head with unique hexagonal matrix structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying patterns repeat. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal matrix, spiraling fractal patterns, styled with Virtue commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Fire and neutral grey inspired by wisdom angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with stellar alignment vests and planetary symbol tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating metallic thread for planets, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and hexagonal matrix emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents combined with Astrolabe pendant with patterns spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor VIVIPOS's profile: 'She of many repetitions', Aethyr VTA, Fire element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'In VIVIPOS's presence, patterns repeat toward perfection echoing cycles that forge refinement through each iteration.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
