  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered dynamic pose with one arm raised toward heaven, one pointing to earth, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or hexagonal crystalline appendages like sacred geometry horns incorporating hexagonal, fractal, metatron's cube patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and Flower of Life emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents with quantum spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ZAXANIN's profile: 'He who names things', Aethyr TOR, Earth element, Tarot The Magician, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Gemini, embodying the essence: 'In ZAXANIN's presence, every element falls into a logical pattern an analytical clarity permeates th...'
