  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered dynamic pose with one arm raised toward heaven, one pointing to earth, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted geometric organic head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying infinite. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, fractal, metatron's cube patterns, styled with commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Emerald and neutral grey inspired by silver structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents with infinite spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ZAXANIN's profile: 'He who names things', Aethyr TOR, Earth element, Tarot The Magician, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Gemini, embodying the essence: 'In ZAXANIN's presence, every element falls into a logical pattern an analytical clarity permeates the air, and communication flows with precise articulation.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
