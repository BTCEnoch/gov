  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered nurturing pose with arms open in welcoming embrace, chibi proportions with large translucent shifting structured head with unique vesica_piscis structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating vesica_piscis, fibonacci_spiral, wave_interference patterns, styled with Dominion guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by lunar and neutral grey inspired by wisdom fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with vision-seeking tunics and Crystal gazer robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating Translucent vision silk, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and vesica_piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals combined with scrying mirror with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor DOXMAEL's profile: 'He who establishes the night', Aethyr TEX, Water element, Tarot The Empress, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Taurus, embodying the essence: 'In DOXMAEL's presence, boundaries between worlds grow thin a liminal magic threads through the air, weaving together realities in secret hermetic harmony.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
