  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large prismatic geometric fractal head with unique Merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Merkaba, Flower of Life, Vesica Piscis patterns, styled with Power commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by crimson and neutral grey inspired by prismatic angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with prismatic Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor VOANAMB's profile: 'He to whom truth is relative', Aethyr VTA, Fire element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'In VOANAMB's presence, truth shifts with perspective every context and season refracts reality into a different hue of understanding.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
