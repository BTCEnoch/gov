  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered authoritative standing pose with arms crossed over geometric chest piece, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or tetrahedral spike-like projections from the head incorporating tetrahedron, merkaba, flower_of_life patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with elemental spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TEDOOND's profile: 'He who demands obedience', Aethyr VTA, Fire element, Tarot The Emperor, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'When TEDOOND stands before you, pure law manifests wild forces are bound to stern vectors, compelled...' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
