  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered authoritative standing pose with arms crossed over geometric chest piece, chibi proportions with large prismatic angular divine head with unique tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying divine Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating tetrahedron, merkaba, flower_of_life patterns, styled with Dominion guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Crimson and neutral grey inspired by energy angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with horoscope chart capes and planetary symbol tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating Celestial-patterned velvet, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade combined with planetary talisman with divine spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TEDOOND's profile: 'He who demands obedience', Aethyr VTA, Fire element, Tarot The Emperor, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'When TEDOOND stands before you, pure law manifests wild forces are bound to stern vectors, compelled into divine order.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
