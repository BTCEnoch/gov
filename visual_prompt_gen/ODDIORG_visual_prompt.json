  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large prismatic fractal fractal head with unique tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying fractal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating tetrahedron, merkaba, fractal triangulation patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by crimson and neutral grey inspired by shifting angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface with fractal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ODDIORG's profile: 'He of fire and justice', Aethyr ZIP, Fire element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'When ODDIORG stands before you, an inner alchemy begins will and psyche are tempered in a crucible of sacred number.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
