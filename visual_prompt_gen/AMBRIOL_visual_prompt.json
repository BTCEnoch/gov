  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered howling pose with head tilted toward lunar geometry, chibi proportions with large wave translucent Sacred head with unique Vesica Piscis structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying gentle Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Vesica Piscis, Wave Spiral, Merkaba lattice patterns, styled with Angel guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Indigo and neutral grey inspired by intuition angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with taiji pattern sashes and wu wei minimalist garments with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating hemp for simplicity, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Vesica Piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like lunar crescent with silver geometric inscriptions combined with bamboo staff with gentle spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor AMBRIOL's profile: 'He who continuously comforts', Aethyr LOE, Fire element, Tarot The Moon, Sephirot Yesod, Zodiac Pisces, embodying the essence: 'When AMBRIOL stands before you, turmoil hushes into a gentle lullaby storm-tossed hearts are soothed by ember-warm dreams of solace.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
