  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted fractal crystalline head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Hexagonal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, fibonacci spiral, merkaba patterns, styled with Angel guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by silver and neutral grey inspired by transformative structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with vision-seeking tunics and prophetic sight capes with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating prophetic gauze, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents combined with Crystal ball with Hexagonal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor GMTZIAM's profile: 'She who knows only herself', Aethyr RII, Earth element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'In GMTZIAM's presence, the mind becomes a poet's map introspective verses chart the soul's landscape, guiding an inner journey of profound self-discovery.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
