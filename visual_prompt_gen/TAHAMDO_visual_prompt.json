  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered authoritative standing pose with arms crossed over geometric chest piece, chibi proportions with large luminous geometric multifaceted head with unique tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating tetrahedron, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with Principality empyrean influences. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast inspired by Electric and neutral grey inspired by blue ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with trigram sashes and change-dynamic capes with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating bamboo-woven fabrics, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade combined with bagua mirror with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TAHAMDO's profile: 'He who lives according to his name', Aethyr OXO, Air element, Tarot The Emperor, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'When TAHAMDO is invoked, all facets of the self lock into harmony utterance, act, and essence moving in perfectly principled step.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
