  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered nurturing pose with arms open in welcoming embrace, chibi proportions with large geometric Translucent crystalline head with unique Flower of Life structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying comforting Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Flower of Life, Platonic solids, Merkaba patterns, styled with Angel guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Emerald and neutral grey inspired by strength structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with Major/Minor suit robes and tower-structured vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating layered paper-like fabrics, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and Flower of Life emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals combined with trump symbol brooch with comforting spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor SOAGEEL's profile: 'He who helps the most', Aethyr NIA, Earth element, Tarot The Empress, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Taurus, embodying the essence: 'As SOAGEEL approaches, a comforting warmth enfolds the space generosity and support flow freely, urging everyone to give and care for one another.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
