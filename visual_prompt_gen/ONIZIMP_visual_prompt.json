  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered nurturing pose with arms open in welcoming embrace, chibi proportions with large prismatic angular geometric head with unique hexagonal lattice structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Platonic. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal lattice, dodecahedron patterns, styled with Virtue commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by shifting and neutral grey inspired by dynamic structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal lattice emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals with Platonic spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ONIZIMP's profile: 'He who brings labor', Aethyr TOR, Earth element, Tarot The Empress, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Taurus, embodying the essence: 'In ONIZIMP's presence, one is stirred to industrious action the environment buzzes with motivating energy, making productivity feel natural and rewarding.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
