  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted prismatic geometric head with unique fractal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal, merkaba, flower_of_life patterns, styled with Angel guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by blue and neutral grey inspired by wisdom angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and fractal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor DOANZIN's profile: 'He who names the waters', Aethyr ZIP, Fire element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'In DOANZIN's presence, hidden patterns reveal their true names granting authority over unseen tides and the shapes they take.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
