  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large prismatic crystalline Hexagonal head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Hexagonal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, fractal, vesica_piscis patterns, styled with Power commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and neutral grey inspired by blue fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with change-dynamic capes and oracle consultant tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating flexible cotton for adaptation, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents combined with change book pendant with Hexagonal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor DIALOIA's profile: 'The god where truth is', Aethyr ARN, Water element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'When DIALOIA is near, truth stands revealed: her presence is the embodied Logos, enthroned wherever clarity reigns.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
