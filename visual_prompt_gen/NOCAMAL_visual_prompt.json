  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered forward-leaning pose with hands gripping ethereal reins, chibi proportions with large translucent geometric Spiral head with unique spiral structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Spiral. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating spiral, hexagonal_lattice, mobius_strip patterns, styled with Virtue influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by silver and neutral grey inspired by lunar fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with oracle consultant tunics and trigram sashes with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating bamboo-woven fabrics, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and spiral emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents combined with hexagram coins with Spiral spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor NOCAMAL's profile: 'He who is servant of the arrow', Aethyr LIT, Water element, Tarot The Chariot, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Cancer, embodying the essence: 'When NOCAMAL is near, discernment hums in measured harmony wisdom unfolding like a deliberate, guiding hymn.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
