  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large prismatic multi-faceted fractal head with unique octahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating octahedron, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with Seraph commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and dark grey with high contrast inspired by electric ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and octahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface with ethereal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor OSIDAIA's profile: 'He who is the god of truth', Aethyr LIN, Air element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'When OSIDAIA is invoked, a clarifying radiance floods the scene nothing corrupt can hide from this illuminating truth that shines in every nook.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
