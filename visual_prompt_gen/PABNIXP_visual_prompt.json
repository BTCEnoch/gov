  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered authoritative standing pose with arms crossed over geometric chest piece, chibi proportions with large prismatic interconnected geometric head with unique merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying cosmic. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating merkaba, flower_of_life, hexagonal_lattice patterns, styled with Seraph commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by shifting and neutral grey inspired by dynamic structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with cosmic spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor PABNIXP's profile: 'He who governs', Aethyr BAG, Earth element, Tarot The Emperor, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'In PABNIXP's presence, things naturally fall into line a calm but firm direction organizes every effort, instilling a sense of duty and responsibility in all.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
