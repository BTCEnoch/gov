  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered blessing pose with both hands raised in sacred mudra, chibi proportions with large translucent Sacred dimensional head with unique vesica_piscis structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying sacred Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating vesica_piscis, merkaba_star patterns, styled with Throne marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by azure and neutral grey fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with observer effect capes and Wave-particle duality garments with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating probabilistic patterns on cotton, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and vesica_piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals combined with particle accelerator ring with sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor VALGARS's profile: 'He who works with that which is', Aethyr LIL, Water element, Tarot The Hierophant, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Taurus, embodying the essence: 'VALGARS's presence is like that of a master artisan at work reality itself feels malleable, with base circumstances transmuting into something sacred.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
