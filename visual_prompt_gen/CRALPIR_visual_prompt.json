  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered transformative striding pose with scythe-like geometric tool, chibi proportions with large flame geometric planes head with unique tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying transformative. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating tetrahedron, merkaba patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: dark grey with intensity inspired by Crimson and neutral grey inspired by golden angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with pulsing Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with transformative spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor CRALPIR's profile: 'He of bright joy', Aethyr ZIP, Fire element, Tarot Death, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Scorpio, embodying the essence: 'In CRALPIR's presence, despair yields to comfort like the triumphant solace of sunrise after a long night on the battlefield.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
