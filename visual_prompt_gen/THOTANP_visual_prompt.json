  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered gentle pose with hands in taming gesture over geometric beast, chibi proportions with large translucent geometric divine head with unique dodecahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying wind divine. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating dodecahedron, wave_spiral patterns, styled with Seraph Winds influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by lunar and neutral grey inspired by wisdom fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with stellar alignment vests and Zodiac-embroidered robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating Celestial-patterned velvet, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and dodecahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like solar medallion with golden ratio geometric design combined with star map scroll with wind spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor THOTANP's profile: 'She whose visits brings victory', Aethyr PAZ, Water element, Tarot Strength, Sephirot Tiphareth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'In THOTANP's presence, triumphant momentum swells like a victorious wind providing the precise updraft for evolution to leap forward.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
