  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered gentle pose with hands in taming gesture over geometric beast, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating dodecahedron, wave_spiral patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and vesica_piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like solar medallion with golden ratio geometric design with ethereal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor THOTANP's profile: 'She whose visits brings victory', Aethyr PAZ, Water element, Tarot Strength, Sephirot Tiphareth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'In THOTANP's presence, triumphant momentum swells like a victorious wind providing the precise updra...'
