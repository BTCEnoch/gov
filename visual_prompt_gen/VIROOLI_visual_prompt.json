  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered authoritative standing pose with arms crossed over geometric chest piece, chibi proportions with large translucent solid sacred head with unique fractal wave structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying sacred Fractal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal wave, nested hexagonal patterns, styled with Archangel marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Azure and light grey with metallic sheen inspired by spiritual fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with yin-yang balanced tunics and taiji pattern sashes with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating cotton with circular patterns, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and fractal wave emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade combined with Bagua mirror with sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor VIROOLI's profile: 'He who made the first nest', Aethyr ZOM, Water element, Tarot The Emperor, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'In VIROOLI's presence, one feels held within a primordial sanctuary an inner sacred chamber built before any outer realm can be commanded.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
