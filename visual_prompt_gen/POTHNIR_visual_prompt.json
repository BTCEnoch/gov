  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large translucent prismatic ethereal head with unique vesica_piscis structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying balanced Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating vesica_piscis, merkaba_star, flower_of_life patterns, styled with Throne balanced influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by wisdom and neutral grey inspired by silver fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and vesica_piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals with balanced spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor POTHNIR's profile: 'Son of the three fold throne', Aethyr PAZ, Water element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'In POTHNIR's presence, vision spans threefold time past, present, and future refract together into a single, balanced ray.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
