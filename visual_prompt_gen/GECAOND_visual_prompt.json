  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large prismatic multi-faceted crystalline head with unique Merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying sacred harmonious. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Merkaba, Flower of Life, Hexagonal fractal patterns, styled with Seraph commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by fire and dark grey with intensity inspired by wisdom angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with horoscope chart capes and stellar alignment vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating flowing silk for cosmic movement, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals combined with planetary talisman with sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor GECAOND's profile: 'She who only obeys', Aethyr ZIM, Fire element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'When GECAOND is near, chaos finds pattern sparks of metamorphosis codify disorder into sacred rite and harmonious flight.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
