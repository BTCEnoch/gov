  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating hexagonal_matrix, fractal_water_crystal patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and vesica_piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents with ethereal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ADVORPT's profile: 'She who silently watches', Aethyr TEX, Water element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'In ADVORPT's presence, an unseen sentinel seems to be watching quietly a patient, observant hush tha...'
