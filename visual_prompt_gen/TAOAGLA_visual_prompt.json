  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered authoritative standing pose with arms crossed over geometric chest piece, chibi proportions with large translucent geometric prismatic head with unique fractal_wave structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying cosmic. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal_wave, merkaba_tetrahedron, flower_of_life patterns, styled with Seraph commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Azure and neutral grey inspired by electric fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and fractal_wave emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with cosmic spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TAOAGLA's profile: 'He who becomes the foremost beginning', Aethyr TEX, Water element, Tarot The Emperor, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Aries, embodying the essence: 'When TAOAGLA is near, a pioneering spark ignites the air it feels like the universe is beginning anew, led forward by an originative force.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
