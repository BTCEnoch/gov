  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large translucent solid fluid head with unique dodecahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying cosmic. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating dodecahedron, vesica_piscis patterns, styled with commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by clarity and metallic light grey inspired by silver fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and dodecahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals with cosmic spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TIARPAX's profile: 'He whose name means truth', Aethyr LIT, Water element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'When TIARPAX is near, a higher truth becomes evident as if the microcosm and macrocosm suddenly recognize each other in perfect reflection.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
