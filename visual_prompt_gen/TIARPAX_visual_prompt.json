  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered balanced pose holding geometric scales in one hand, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating dodecahedron, vesica_piscis patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and metallic light grey fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and Flower_of_Life emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like rose of victory with seven-fold geometric petals with ethereal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TIARPAX's profile: 'He whose name means truth', Aethyr LIT, Water element, Tarot Justice, Sephirot Netzach, Zodiac Libra, embodying the essence: 'When TIARPAX is near, a higher truth becomes evident as if the microcosm and macrocosm suddenly reco...'
