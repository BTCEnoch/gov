  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered transformative striding pose with scythe-like geometric tool, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted solid translucent head with unique fractal mountain structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal mountain, hexagonal lattice, spiral vortex patterns, styled with Seraph commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by silver and neutral grey inspired by blue structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and fractal mountain emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor MIRZIND's profile: 'He who is from the Waters of Torment', Aethyr VTI, Earth element, Tarot Death, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Scorpio, embodying the essence: 'As MIRZIND approaches, the atmosphere crackles with intensity pent-up emotions erupt in a cleansing release, tempered afterward into steeled resilience.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
