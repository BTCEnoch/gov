  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or tetrahedral spike-like projections from the head incorporating tetrahedron, stellated octahedron patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface with celestial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor PRISTAC's profile: 'He who has the likeness of a Holy One', Aethyr ZID, Fire element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'When PRISTAC is near, the air resonates with a higher model mortals find themselves drawn to echo a ...'
