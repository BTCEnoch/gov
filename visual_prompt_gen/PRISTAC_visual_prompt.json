  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large prismatic multi-faceted geometric head with unique tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Tetrahedron. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating tetrahedron, stellated octahedron patterns, styled with Power commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by fire and neutral grey inspired by wisdom angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with tower-structured vests and Major/Minor suit robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating layered paper-like fabrics, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface combined with wheel of fortune medallion with Tetrahedron spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor PRISTAC's profile: 'He who has the likeness of a Holy One', Aethyr ZID, Fire element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'When PRISTAC is near, the air resonates with a higher model mortals find themselves drawn to echo a more celestial harmony.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
