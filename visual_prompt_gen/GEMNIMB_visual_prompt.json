  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large translucent geometric potential head with unique hexagonal_water_crystal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying potential. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal_water_crystal, spiral_wave, vesica_piscis patterns, styled with Cherub influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by nature and neutral grey inspired by mercurial fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and hexagonal_water_crystal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents with potential spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor GEMNIMB's profile: 'He who is only for a season', Aethyr TEX, Water element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'In GEMNIMB's presence, every moment feels transient and precious like a season that blooms brilliantly then passes, encouraging adaptability to life's constant change.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
