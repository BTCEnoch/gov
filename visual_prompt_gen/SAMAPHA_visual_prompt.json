  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered gentle pose with hands in taming gesture over geometric beast, chibi proportions with large translucent flowing edges head with unique Vesica_Piscis structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Vesica_Piscis, Fibonacci_spiral patterns, styled with Principality influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Golden and neutral grey inspired by intelligence fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and Vesica_Piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like solar medallion with golden ratio geometric design with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor SAMAPHA's profile: 'He who is with continuity', Aethyr ZOM, Water element, Tarot Strength, Sephirot Tiphareth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'When SAMAPHA is near, a golden thread of continuity weaves through the atmosphere, ensuring identity endures through every transformation.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
