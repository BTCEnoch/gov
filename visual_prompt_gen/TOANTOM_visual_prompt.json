  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered dynamic pose with one arm raised toward heaven, one pointing to earth, chibi proportions with large translucent geometric head with unique fractal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal, sacred geometry, platonic solids patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and dark grey with high contrast inspired by blue ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and fractal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents with ethereal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TOANTOM's profile: 'He who loves knowledge', Aethyr ASP, Air element, Tarot The Magician, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Gemini, embodying the essence: 'In TOANTOM's presence, even stones seem to whisper knowledge an inquisitive hush invites discovery as the scholar in you awakens with curiosity.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
