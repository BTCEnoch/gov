  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered gentle pose with hands in taming gesture over geometric beast, chibi proportions with large translucent solid Sacred head with unique vesica_piscis structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying aura Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating vesica_piscis, merkaba_star patterns, styled with Cherub Authority influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by blue and neutral grey inspired by intelligence fluid draped garments with wave geometric patterns fused with prophetic sight capes and vision-seeking tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for flow and depth, incorporating oracle-woven cotton, elaborate with shifting Water element curved motifs and descending patterns and vesica_piscis emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like solar medallion with golden ratio geometric design combined with Crystal ball with aura spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rippling water wisps and droplet particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor AXXIARG's profile: 'He whose name is Flame', Aethyr PAZ, Water element, Tarot Strength, Sephirot Tiphareth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'When AXXIARG is near, an aura of humble authority prevails leadership is felt as service, bearing the weight of communal purpose.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
