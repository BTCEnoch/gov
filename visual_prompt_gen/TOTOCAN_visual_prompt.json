  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large translucent multi-faceted geometric head with unique octahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying fractal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating octahedron, fractal spiral, merkaba patterns, styled with commands empyrean influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and mid-grey with cool undertones inspired by azure ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and octahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents with fractal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TOTOCAN's profile: 'He who drives the cycles', Aethyr CHR, Air element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'In TOTOCAN's presence, all things align into steady cadence each moment regulated by a persistent, calming rhythm that never falters.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
