  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered joyful dancing pose with arms raised in celebration, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or merkaba-inspired rotating geometric hair ornaments incorporating merkaba, flower_of_life, solar_mandala patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with radiating Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and dodecahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like geometric emblem with celestial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor LAPARIN's profile: 'He who is the protector of man', Aethyr ZIM, Fire element, Tarot The Sun, Sephirot Tiphereth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'In LAPARIN's presence, faith stands as a bulwark of light a solar bastion where holy ground meets th...'
