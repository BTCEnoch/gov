  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered joyful dancing pose with arms raised in celebration, chibi proportions with large radiant divine Sacred head with unique merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying holy Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating merkaba, flower_of_life, solar_mandala patterns, styled with Cherub holy influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Golden and neutral grey inspired by energy angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with Crystal gazer robes and vision-seeking tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating oracle-woven cotton, elaborate with radiating Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like geometric emblem combined with prophetic lens with holy spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor LAPARIN's profile: 'He who is the protector of man', Aethyr ZIM, Fire element, Tarot The Sun, Sephirot Tiphereth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'In LAPARIN's presence, faith stands as a bulwark of light a solar bastion where holy ground meets the roar of battle without yielding.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
