  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large prismatic geometric Structured head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, merkaba, flower_of_life patterns, styled with Cherub influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by intelligence and neutral grey inspired by wisdom structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with stellar alignment vests and Zodiac-embroidered robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating flowing silk for cosmic movement, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface combined with planetary talisman with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor POCISNI's profile: 'He who visits those in Heaven', Aethyr BAG, Earth element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'As POCISNI approaches, a hush of reverence falls a bridge between realms opens, and aspirations take wing toward the heavens under his spiritual guidance.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
