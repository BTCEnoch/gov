  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or merkaba-inspired rotating geometric hair ornaments incorporating merkaba, flower_of_life, dodecahedron patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and icosahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface with primordial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ORANCIR's profile: 'He who is above and below', Aethyr NIA, Earth element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'In ORANCIR's presence, the above and below unite in harmony a holistic balance is struck, as if all ...'
