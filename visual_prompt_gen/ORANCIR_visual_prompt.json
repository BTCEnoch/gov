  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large fluid geometric organic head with unique merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Merkaba. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating merkaba, flower_of_life, dodecahedron patterns, styled with Principality influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by wisdom and neutral grey inspired by intelligence structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with Zodiac-embroidered robes and stellar alignment vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating dark fabrics with star points, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface combined with Astrolabe pendant with Merkaba spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ORANCIR's profile: 'He who is above and below', Aethyr NIA, Earth element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'In ORANCIR's presence, the above and below unite in harmony a holistic balance is struck, as if all aspects of existence integrate into one complete whole.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
