  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered transformative striding pose with scythe-like geometric tool, chibi proportions with large fractal prismatic flame head with unique Merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Merkaba, Flower of Life, Tetractys patterns, styled with Seraph influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by crimson and neutral grey inspired by fire angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with Wave-particle duality garments and entanglement-linked robes with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating probabilistic patterns on cotton, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade combined with particle accelerator ring with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor OPMACAS's profile: 'He who is from the beginning', Aethyr DEO, Fire element, Tarot Death, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Scorpio, embodying the essence: 'In OPMACAS's presence, form emerges from formlessness a primordial fire breathing shape into the void.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
