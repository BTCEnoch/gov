  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered kneeling pose pouring geometric patterns like starlight, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted prismatic geometric head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Hexagonal. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, fractal, geodesic patterns, styled with Throne marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Azure and neutral grey inspired by wisdom structured solid robes with crystalline geometric patterns fused with entanglement-linked robes and observer effect capes with flat with sharpie-style lines for stability and grounding, incorporating metallic quantum dots, elaborate with shifting Earth element square motifs and foundational patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns combined with wave function staff with Hexagonal spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like crystalline dust wisps and mineral particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor CALZIRG's profile: 'She who is in the firmament', Aethyr LIN, Earth element, Tarot The Star, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Aquarius, embodying the essence: 'As CALZIRG approaches, the horizon stretches skyward an expansive, lofty feeling as if the very heavens have descended to meet the earth.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
