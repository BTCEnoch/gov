  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered kneeling pose pouring geometric patterns like starlight, chibi proportions with large prismatic multi-faceted geometric head with unique fractal tetrahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating fractal tetrahedron, merkaba star, flower of life patterns, styled with Throne marshals influences. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast inspired by Electric and neutral grey inspired by blue ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with systems dynamics vests and chaos theory capes with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating complex system textiles, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and fractal tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns combined with emergence calculator with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor SOCHIAL's profile: 'He who burns up the past', Aethyr LEA, Air element, Tarot The Star, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Aquarius, embodying the essence: 'In SOCHIAL's presence, stagnation combusts into change her radical energy ignites a cathartic blaze that frees and renews the spirit.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
