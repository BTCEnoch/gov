  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered kneeling pose pouring geometric patterns like starlight, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating Merkaba, Flower of Life, Fractal hexagonal patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast and neutral grey angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Metatron's Cube emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns with primordial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor PONODOL's profile: 'He who destroys and creates', Aethyr ICH, Fire element, Tarot The Star, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Aquarius, embodying the essence: 'When PONODOL stands before you, obsolete forms shatter a cataclysmic forge breaking the old and midw...'
