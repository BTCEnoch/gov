  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered kneeling pose pouring geometric patterns like starlight, chibi proportions with large prismatic geometric crystalline head with unique Merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating Merkaba, Flower of Life, Fractal hexagonal patterns, styled with Power commands influences. Outfit is unique: dark grey with high contrast inspired by Electric and neutral grey inspired by blue angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with chaos theory capes and systems dynamics vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating Fractal-patterned silk, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns combined with strange attractor model with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor PONODOL's profile: 'He who destroys and creates', Aethyr ICH, Fire element, Tarot The Star, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Aquarius, embodying the essence: 'When PONODOL stands before you, obsolete forms shatter a cataclysmic forge breaking the old and midwifing new laws into existence.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
