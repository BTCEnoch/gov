  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered standing pose with one hand raised holding an ethereal lantern, other hand in contemplative gesture, chibi proportions with large translucent prismatic ethereal head with unique dodecahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying sacred still. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating dodecahedron, fractal lattice, merkaba patterns, styled with Archangel marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Silver and mid-grey with cool undertones inspired by mercurial ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with entanglement-linked robes and observer effect capes with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating metallic quantum dots, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and dodecahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like caduceus of communication with intertwined geometric serpents combined with wave function staff with sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor ZAFASAI's profile: 'He who is in emptiness', Aethyr ZEN, Air element, Tarot The Hermit, Sephirot Hod, Zodiac Virgo, embodying the essence: 'In ZAFASAI's presence, solitude feels sacred the air grows still and serene, inviting a detached peace that softens every edge of being.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
