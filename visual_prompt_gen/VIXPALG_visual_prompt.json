  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered crouched binding pose with chains of geometric patterns, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted geometric edges head with unique octahedral structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Octahedron. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating octahedral, fractal spirals patterns, styled with Angel guides influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by silver and neutral grey inspired by mercurial ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns fused with change-dynamic capes and oracle consultant tunics with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, incorporating black/white duality weaves, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and octahedral emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns combined with hexagram coins with Octahedron spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor VIXPALG's profile: 'He who consumes', Aethyr ASP, Air element, Tarot The Devil, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Capricorn, embodying the essence: 'In VIXPALG's presence, the atmosphere grows intensely heavy and demanding an insatiable force that hungers for more, pulling all energy into its voracious embrace.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
