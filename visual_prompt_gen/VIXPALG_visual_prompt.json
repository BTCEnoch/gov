The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered crouched binding pose with chains of geometric patterns, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or octahedral fractal horns resembling diamond structures incorporating octahedral, fractal spirals patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and neutral grey ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and Merkaba emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like cup of understanding with triangular geometric patterns with primordial spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor VIXPALG's profile: 'He who consumes', Aethyr ASP, Air element, Tarot The Devil, Sephirot Binah, Zodiac Capricorn, embodying the essence: 'In VIXPALG's presence, the atmosphere grows intensely heavy and demanding an insatiable force that h...'
