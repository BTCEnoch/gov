  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered transformative striding pose with scythe-like geometric tool, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or octahedral fractal horns resembling diamond structures incorporating octahedral, fractal, merkaba patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and dark grey with high contrast ethereal flowing robes with geometric wind patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for depth and movement, elaborate with shifting Air element glyphs and spiral motifs and Flower of Life emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like sword of severity with angular geometric blade with quantum spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like faint wind wisps and floating geometric particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor CUCARPT's profile: 'She who replaces what was with something similar', Aethyr LEA, Air element, Tarot Death, Sephirot Geburah, Zodiac Scorpio, embodying the essence: 'In CUCARPT's presence, every ending glows with a new dawn an echo-forge where conclusions transform ...' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
