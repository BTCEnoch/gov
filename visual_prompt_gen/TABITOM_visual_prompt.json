  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large multifaceted prismatic oak-wood head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying paradoxical sunlight. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with Throne marshals influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by Saffron and neutral grey inspired by spiritual transcendent layered robes combining all elemental patterns fused with as above so below tunics and emerald tablet vests with flat with sharpie-style lines for unity and synthesis, incorporating axiom-embroidered linen, elaborate with shifting Spirit element pentagram motifs and unifying patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface combined with philosophical mercury vial with paradoxical spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rainbow essence wisps and transcendent particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TABITOM's profile: 'He who is like fire', Aethyr ZAX, Spirit element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'When TABITOM is near, a paradoxical sunlight fills the air a spirit-fire that neither burns nor dims, but wholly transmutes.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
