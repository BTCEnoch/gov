  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered pouring pose with hands managing flow between vessels, chibi proportions with large prismatic cosmic interconnectedness head with unique hexagonal structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying cosmic. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating hexagonal, merkaba, flower of life patterns, styled with Throne influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by shifting and neutral grey inspired by dynamic transcendent layered robes combining all elemental patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for unity and synthesis, elaborate with shifting Spirit element pentagram motifs and unifying patterns and hexagonal emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like orb of mercy with hexagonal geometric surface with cosmic spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like rainbow essence wisps and transcendent particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor TABITOM's profile: 'He who is like fire', Aethyr ZAX, Spirit element, Tarot Temperance, Sephirot Chesed, Zodiac Sagittarius, embodying the essence: 'When TABITOM is near, a paradoxical sunlight fills the air a spirit-fire that neither burns nor dims, but wholly transmutes.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
