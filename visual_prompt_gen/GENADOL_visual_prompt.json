  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered gentle pose with hands in taming gesture over geometric beast, chibi proportions with large multi-faceted crystalline head resembling a shifting merkaba structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth. Hair or geometric crystalline appendages incorporating octahedron, flame-vortex, star-tetrahedron patterns from sacred geometry symbolism. Outfit is unique: neutral grey and dark grey with intensity angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and Star tetrahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like solar medallion with golden ratio geometric design with quantum-elemental spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor GENADOL's profile: 'He who only attracts', Aethyr DEO, Fire element, Tarot Strength, Sephirot Tiphareth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'In GENADOL's presence, fate feels malleable his magnetic charisma draws life's iron filings into ali...'
