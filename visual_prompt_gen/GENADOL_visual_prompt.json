  "prompt": "A chibi-style character in greyscale construction paper cut-out aesthetic, flat shapes with sharp edges and minimal shading, on transparent background. The face is solid black with no features. The body is in a front-facing centered gentle pose with hands in taming gesture over geometric beast, chibi proportions with large geometric prismatic crystalline head with unique octahedron structure suggesting stillness and motion through sharp, layered cut-outs with drawn depth, embodying Sacred. Hair or geometric appendages incorporating octahedron, flame-vortex, star-tetrahedron patterns, styled with Cherub commands influences. Outfit is unique: neutral grey inspired by crimson and dark grey with intensity inspired by fire angular armor-like robes with flame geometric patterns fused with Wave-particle duality garments and observer effect capes with flat with sharpie-style lines for heat and energy, incorporating probabilistic patterns on cotton, elaborate with shifting Fire element triangular motifs and ascending patterns and octahedron emblem on chest; texture flat with sharpie-style lines for depth. Include subtle accessory like solar medallion with golden ratio geometric design combined with wave function staff with Sacred spiraling energy emanations. Environmental effect: sacred geometric field creating geometric aura patterns around the character with subtle magical essence emanations like flickering flame wisps and ember particles. Emulate construction paper layering style exactly, but make this visually unique based on Governor GENADOL's profile: 'He who only attracts', Aethyr DEO, Fire element, Tarot Strength, Sephirot Tiphareth, Zodiac Leo, embodying the essence: 'In GENADOL's presence, fate feels malleable his magnetic charisma draws life's iron filings into alignment.' Resolution 512x512, optimized for layering in Enochian Cyphers game and WebGL rendering with TAP hypertoken metadata embedding.",
