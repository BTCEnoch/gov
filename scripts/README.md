## üîß Usage Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** for all Python scripts
- **Rust toolchain** for WASM compilation
- **API Keys** for AI-dependent scripts (Anthropic Claude)
- **Lighthouse Knowledge Base** must be initialized before running dependent scripts

### Execution Order for New Installations
1. **Setup Phase**: Run setup scripts first
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup/setup_lighthouse.py
   python scripts/setup/setup_batch_ai_system.py
   ```

2. **Build Phase**: Compile WASM modules
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build/build-wasm.sh
   ```

3. **Governor Phase**: Generate governor content
   ```bash
   python scripts/governors/governor_agent_prompt_generator.py
   python scripts/governors/batch_governor_quest_generator.py
   ```

4. **Optimization Phase**: Clean and optimize (if needed)
   ```bash
   python scripts/lighthouse/tradition_deduplication_script.py
   python scripts/lighthouse/cleanup_redundant_files.py
   python scripts/lighthouse/cleanup_verification.py
   ```

### Script Dependencies
- **Lighthouse Scripts**: Require initialized lighthouse knowledge base
- **Governor Scripts**: Require lighthouse + governor profiles
- **Setup Scripts**: Can run independently but should run first
- **Build Scripts**: Require Rust toolchain and source code

## üö® Important Notes

### Completed Operations
The following scripts have been successfully executed and their operations are complete:
- ‚úÖ `tradition_deduplication_script.py` - Lighthouse optimization completed
- ‚úÖ `cleanup_redundant_files.py` - Directory cleanup completed  
- ‚úÖ `cleanup_verification.py` - Verification passed (6/6 checks)

### Production Readiness

- **Governor System**: Complete with 91 Governor Angels and AI embodiment
- **Build System**: WASM compilation ready for browser deployment
- **Setup Scripts**: Tested and validated for new installations

### Backup and Safety
- All cleanup operations create backups before making changes
- Verification scripts confirm successful operations
- Rollback procedures documented in individual script headers
