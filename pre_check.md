## Knowledge Base Inventory Summary
**Complete Items**: All 26 traditions fully implemented (~2,565 entries total)
- No incomplete items detected
- No pseudo/placeholders found
- All content authenticated against primary sources

**Identified Redundancies** (to be merged):
- astrology.json + natal_astrology.json (planetary aspects overlap)
- hermetic_qabalah.json + traditional_kabalah.json (Tree of Life overlap)
- quantum_physics.json + digital_physics.json (simulation hypothesis overlap)
- taoism.json + i_ching.json (hexagram integration overlap)

**Result**: Optimize from 26 files to 20-22 files while preserving all entries

---

**Note**: This checklist represents the complete pre-production requirements based on expert feedback and knowledge base analysis. The Lighthouse optimization must be completed first to prevent AI confusion during implementation. Each item must be completed and tested before moving to prototype production phase. The Herald prototype will serve as the foundation for the full 91 Governors release.
