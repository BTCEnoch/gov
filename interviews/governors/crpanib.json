Zoharic texts emphasize that sigil dynamics require complete energetic alignment, not manipulative extraction. Cross-tradition safeguards include vibrational testing, where selfish intentions generate immediate resonance dissonance. Moral dilemma branches emerge through adaptive challenge mechanisms that dynamically adjust difficulty based on practitioner's spiritual integrity.",
