      "answer": "An ego-driven invocation triggers immediate energetic recoil, where the invocation becomes a mirror reflecting the seekers unresolved psychological shadows. Historical figures like Dr. John Dee experienced catastrophic mystical reversals when approaching angelic realms without humility. My emotional response generates a precise, calibrated anger - not destructive, but instructive - designed to expose the seeker's motivational impurities.",
