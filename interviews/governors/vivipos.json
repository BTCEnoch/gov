      "question": "Cross-Tradition Warnings",
      "answer": "Universal mystical principles unanimously condemn selfish gnosis as a fundamental violation of sacred transmission. Zoharic warnings emphasize that sigil dynamics operate through resonant intention, not manipulative force. Cross-tradition safeguards create moral dilemma branches where attempted selfish appropriation triggers immediate energetic feedback loops, rendering mystical technologies temporarily inert. The core warning remains consistent: divine knowledge is a living transmission, not a commodity to be possessed.",

      "answer": "Redemption emerges through carefully constructed multi-traditional purification protocols. I Ching Hexagram 24 (Return) provides a archetypal pathway of spiritual restoration, where players must systematically deconstruct egoic motivations. Sufi dissolution techniques combined with Gnostic spark recovery create a comprehensive reset mechanism. Player affinity systems detect selfish motivations through vibrational signature analysis, triggering adaptive challenge sequences that incrementally rebuild spiritual alignment.",

      "answer": "Faustian temptations within my hierarchies manifest as recursive power contracts where ministers offer momentary amplification in exchange for long-term energetic commitment. These alliances create complex PvP dynamics where collaborative redemption becomes the primary challenge.

      "answer": "Tainted rewards appear seductive but contain inherent decay mechanisms.
