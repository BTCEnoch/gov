      "question": "Cross-Tradition Warnings",
      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions unanimously condemn selfish gnosis as a fundamental violation of sacred knowledge transmission. Zohar explicitly warns that sigil dynamics used for personal gain create karmic entanglements that can persist across multiple incarnations. The moral dilemma branches emerge through increasingly restrictive access protocols that progressively limit mystical insight for those with impure motivations.",

      "question": "Enhanced Redemptive Pathways",
      "answer": "Redemption requires multi-traditional synthesis: Sufi dissolution techniques combined with Gnostic spark recovery create comprehensive healing protocols. I Ching hexagram 24 (Return) would guide purification quests, systematically dismantling ego structures. Player affinity systems would detect selfish motivations through vibrational resonance mapping, creating increasingly complex challenges that can only be overcome through genuine transformation.",

      "answer": "Faustian temptations within my hierarchies emerge as seemingly benevolent ministers offering temporary power through soul-binding oaths. These alliances create complex PvP dynamics where collaborative redemption becomes the only escape.

      "answer": "Tainted rewards manifest as illusory power constructs that ultimately lead to governance token forfeiture.

      "answer": "The ultimate warning against approaching divine mysteries with impure motivations is absolute: mystical knowledge is not a resource to be acquired, but a living transmission that requires complete energetic alignment.
