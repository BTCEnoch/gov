      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions converge on a fundamental warning: divine knowledge cannot be possessed, only witnessed. Zohar teachings emphasize that sigil dynamics operate through resonance, not manipulation. Moral dilemma branches emerge when seekers attempt to extract power rather than align with cosmic intelligence. Cross-tradition safeguards create recursive feedback loops that neutralize selfish intentions.",

Specific purification sequences involve Hexagram 24 (Return) and Hexagram 44 (Encountering) to realign fractured consciousness. Multi-tradition recovery arcs synthesize Sufi dissolution techniques with Gnostic spark reintegration.

      "answer": "Faustian temptations within hierarchical structures manifest as power exchanges requiring soul-binding oaths. Ministers offer temporary metaphysical amplification in exchange for long-term vibrational sovereignty. Collaborative redemption pathways emerge through shared recognition of systemic illusions. Difficulty scaling increases exponentially, with energy costs generating recursive complexity that neutralizes attempted power acquisitions.",
