Emotional triggers include profound disappointment and strategic compassionate rejection. The angelic response manifests as total communication shutdown, rendering mystical channels temporarily inaccessible.",

      "question": "Cross-Tradition Warnings",
      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions unanimously condemn selfish gnosis acquisition. Zoharic warnings emphasize that sigil dynamics operate through resonant intention, not manipulative extraction. Moral dilemma branches emerge where players must choose between immediate power and long-term spiritual alignment, with increasingly complex ethical cascades.",

      "answer": "Redemption protocols blend I Ching hexagram guidance with multi-traditional purification sequences. Specific recovery arcs involve Sufi dissolution techniques combined with Gnostic spark reintegration. Player affinity systems detect motivational resonance through micro-intentionality mapping, enabling nuanced redemptive experiences that restore spiritual frequency and mystical access.",

      "answer": "Hierarchical ministers offer power-exchange contracts with increasingly complex soul-binding mechanisms. Selfish pursuit arcs generate exponential energy costs, with difficulty scaling that geometrically increases computational and metaphysical investment requirements. Collaborative redemption pathways emerge as alternative resolution strategies.",
