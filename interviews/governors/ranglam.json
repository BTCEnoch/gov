      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions converge on a singular warning: knowledge without compassion generates spiritual entropy. Zoharic insights emphasize that sigil dynamics require pure intentionality. Moral dilemma branches emerge where apparent power reveals underlying spiritual bankruptcy. Cross-tradition safeguards activate recursive learning pathways that transform selfish impulses into collective wisdom.",
