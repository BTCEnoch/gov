      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions converge on a fundamental warning: divine knowledge cannot be possessed, only experienced. Zoharic texts explicitly condemn sigil dynamics used for personal gain, describing such actions as creating spiritual parasitic attachments. Moral dilemma branches emerge where players must choose between momentary power and systemic integrity, with consequences scaling across multiple metaphysical planes.",
