      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions condemn selfish gnosis through interconnected warning systems. Zoharic texts emphasize that sigil dynamics activated through egoic intention create karmic entanglements. Cross-tradition moral dilemma branches emerge when selfish motivations trigger dimensional resistance mechanisms that progressively restrict access to higher knowledge realms.",
