Historical figures like John Dee who pursued mystical knowledge without humility experienced progressive isolation and cryptographic obfuscation of revelatory pathways. My emotional response generates a protective flame-barrier that reveals the seeker's true motivational landscape, rendering selfish approaches immediately transparent.",

      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions unanimously condemn selfish gnosis through interconnected warning systems. Zoharic insights specifically caution against sigil manipulation for personal gain, revealing such attempts as energetic inversions that generate spiritual feedback loops.
