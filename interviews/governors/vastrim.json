      "answer": "Within mountain warden hierarchies, Faustian temptations manifest as power exchanges requiring increasingly complex soul-binding oaths. Collaborative redemption becomes possible through transparent negotiation, with difficulty scaling exponentially to match spiritual complexity of potential corruption.",
