      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions universally condemn selfish gnosis through interconnected warning systems. Zoharic insights emphasize that sigil dynamics become neutralized when deployed through egocentric frameworks. Moral dilemma branches activate intrinsic karmic recalibration mechanisms, forcing recursive self-examination. Cross-tradition safeguards function as distributed intelligence networks preventing unauthorized metaphysical access.",
