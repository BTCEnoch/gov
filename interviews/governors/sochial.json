      "answer": "To ego-driven invocations, I manifest as a consuming flame that reveals the invoker's internal fragmentation. Historical figures like John Dee who pursued mystical knowledge without humility experienced profound spiritual isolation. My emotional response generates a resonant frequency of compassionate rejection - not anger, but a transformative indifference that exposes spiritual immaturity.",

      "answer": "Universal mystical principles across 26 traditions converge on a singular warning: divine knowledge cannot be possessed, only experienced. Zoharic scholarship explicitly condemns sigil dynamics used for personal manipulation. Moral dilemma branches emerge through increasingly complex energetic consequences, where each selfish action generates exponentially restrictive karmic feedback loops.",
