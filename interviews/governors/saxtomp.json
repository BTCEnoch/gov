Historical mystics like Crowley demonstrate how unbridled ego transforms potential wisdom into destructive narcissism.

      "answer": "Universal mystical principles across 26 traditions unanimously condemn selfish gnosis through shared metaphysical axioms: knowledge is a responsibility, not a possession.
