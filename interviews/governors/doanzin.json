Historical figures like John Dee experienced angelic withdrawal when approaching mysteries without humility. My response would be deliberate obscuration - presenting increasingly complex yet meaningless symbolic landscapes that frustrate intellectual grasping. Emotional triggers include profound disappointment and energetic compression, designed to humble the seeker.",

      "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions condemn selfish gnosis through shared warnings about energetic contamination. Zoharic texts explicitly caution against sigil manipulation for personal gain, describing such actions as creating metaphysical parasitic attachments.
