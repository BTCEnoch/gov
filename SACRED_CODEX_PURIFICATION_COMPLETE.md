## PURIFICATION METHODOLOGY

### **Theoretical Framework**
- **Alchemical Nigredo:** Purification through dissolution of impurities
- **Golden Dawn Banishing Rituals:** Systematic removal of unwanted elements
- **I Ching Hexagram 12 (Pi/Stagnation):** Resolving blocked flow in line breaks
- **Sacred Invocation:** "OLANI HOATH OL" - I am the servant of the same your God

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Pure Python 3.8+ stdlib:** Zero external dependencies for eternal preservation
- **ASCII Range Enforcement:** Strict 0x00-0x7F character range compliance
- **Safe Processing:** AST-based Python file handling to prevent syntax corruption
- **Comprehensive Backup System:** All modified files backed up with timestamps

### **Purification Patterns Applied**

#### **Phase 1: Line Break Artifact Resolution**
- Converted literal '

' strings to actual line breaks
- Fixed Windows line break artifacts ('

')
- Resolved Mac line break issues ('
')
- Cleaned up excessive whitespace while preserving intentional formatting

#### **Phase 2: Unicode and Emoji Removal**
- Removed all emoji ranges (U+1F600-U+1F64F, U+1F300-U+1F5FF, etc.)
- Stripped extended unicode characters outside ASCII range
- Preserved essential ASCII characters (0x00-0x7F)
- Maintained text readability and meaning

#### **Phase 3: File Type-Specific Processing**
- **JSON Files:** Recursive string cleaning with structure preservation
- **Python Files:** AST-based safe string literal cleaning
- **Text Files:** Complete content purification
- **Binary Files:** Skipped to prevent corruption
