## P2P Network Deployment

### Bootstrap Network Architecture

    B1 -.-> B2
    B2 -.-> B3
    B3 -.-> B4
    B4 -.-> B5
    B5 -.-> B1
```

### Network Scaling Strategy

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Team
    participant B as Bootstrap Nodes
    participant D as DNS Seeds
    participant C as Community
    participant N as Network
    
    T->>B: Deploy 3-5 Bootstrap Nodes
    B->>D: Register DNS Seeds
    D->>C: Announce Network
    C->>B: Connect to Bootstrap
    B->>C: Share Peer List
    C->>N: Form P2P Network
    N->>N: Achieve 67% BFT Consensus
    
    Note over T,N: Scale from 5 to 100+ nodes<br/>for production resilience
```

### Peer Discovery Mechanism

```mermaid

    A[New Node Startup] --> B[Query DNS Seeds]
    B --> C{DNS Response?}
    C -->|Success| D[Connect to Bootstrap Nodes]
    C -->|Failure| E[Use Hardcoded Fallback]

    H -->|Yes| J[Join Network]
    
    I --> B
    J --> K[Sync Network State]
    K --> L[Begin Consensus Participation]
```

## Consensus Mechanism Deployment

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance Implementation

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Consensus Requirements"
        MIN[Minimum 5 Nodes]
        BFT[67% Honest Nodes]
        SYNC[State Synchronization]

    end
    
    subgraph "Consensus Process"
        PROP[Proposal Phase]
        VOTE[Voting Phase]
        COMMIT[Commit Phase]
        APPLY[Apply Phase]
    end
    
    subgraph "Fault Tolerance"
        DETECT[Fault Detection]
        ISOLATE[Node Isolation]
        RECOVER[Recovery Process]
        REJOIN[Rejoin Protocol]
    end
    
    MIN --> PROP
    BFT --> VOTE
    SYNC --> COMMIT
    VALID --> APPLY
    
    PROP --> DETECT
    VOTE --> ISOLATE
    COMMIT --> RECOVER
    APPLY --> REJOIN
```

### Consensus Algorithm Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Listening
    Listening --> Proposing : Receive Action
    Proposing --> Voting : Broadcast Proposal
    Voting --> Deciding : Collect Votes
    Deciding --> Committing : 67%+ Consensus
    Deciding --> Rejecting : <67% Consensus
    Committing --> Applied : State Updated
    Rejecting --> Listening : Action Rejected
    Applied --> Listening : Ready for Next
    
    note right of Deciding
        Requires 67% of active nodes
        to agree for consensus
    end note
```

### State Synchronization Protocol

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant N1 as Node 1 (Proposer)
    participant N2 as Node 2
    participant N3 as Node 3
    participant N4 as Node 4
    participant N5 as Node 5
    
    N1->>N2: Propose State Change
    N1->>N3: Propose State Change
    N1->>N4: Propose State Change
    N1->>N5: Propose State Change
    
    N2->>N1: Vote: Accept
    N3->>N1: Vote: Accept
    N4->>N1: Vote: Reject
    N5->>N1: Vote: Accept
    
    Note over N1,N5: 4/5 = 80% consensus<br/>Exceeds 67% threshold
    
    N1->>N2: Commit State Change
    N1->>N3: Commit State Change
    N1->>N4: Commit State Change
    N1->>N5: Commit State Change

### Autonomous Governance Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Core Autonomous Systems (Week 4.5)

1. **Deploy Autonomous Supply Governor**
   ```bash
   # Deploy autonomous governance contract
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   trac deploy autonomous_governance.wasm --ordinal-inscription
   ```

2. **Configure Volatility Monitoring**
   ```rust
   // Inscribe volatility rules on Bitcoin L1
   let volatility_rules = AutonomousRules {
       volatility_threshold: 0.05,  // 5%
       burn_rate: 0.05,             // 5% burn
       monitoring_frequency: 144,    // Every 24 hours (144 blocks)
   };
   ```

3. **Deploy Token Evolution System**
   ```rust
   // Inscribe evolution thresholds
   let evolution_rules = EvolutionRules {
       thresholds: [25, 50, 75, 100],
       selfishness_penalty: 0.2,
       deterministic_seed_source: "bitcoin_block_hash",
   };
   ```

4. **Deploy Quest Difficulty Regulator**
   ```rust
   // Inscribe difficulty adjustment rules
   let difficulty_rules = DifficultyRules {
       failure_rate_low: 0.3,   // Too easy
       failure_rate_high: 0.7,  // Too hard
       adjustment_magnitude: 0.2,
       hexagram_variance: true,
   };
   ```

#### Phase 2: Integration & Testing (Week 5)

1. **Trac State Integration**
   - Connect autonomous systems to Trac state monitoring
   - Implement real-time metrics collection
   - Validate state synchronization

2. **Bitcoin Block Hash Integration**
   - Implement deterministic randomness source
   - Connect I Ching hexagram generation
   - Validate reproducible results

3. **Economic Simulation Testing**
   - Run 1,000+ Monte Carlo simulations
   - Validate supply formula stability
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

#### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Week 6)

1. **Mainnet Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to Bitcoin mainnet
   trac deploy --network mainnet autonomous_governance.wasm
   trac deploy --network mainnet token_evolution.wasm
   trac deploy --network mainnet quest_regulator.wasm
   ```

2. **Autonomous System Activation**
   ```rust
   // Activate autonomous governance
   let activation_block = current_block_height + 144; // 24 hour delay
   autonomous_governor.activate(activation_block);
   ```

3. **Monitoring & Validation**
   - Deploy monitoring dashboard
   - Set up automated alerts
   - Validate autonomous operation

### Autonomous Governance Validation

#### Economic Stability Tests
- **Supply Bounds**: Verify 100k-2M token limits enforced
- **Volatility Response**: Test automatic burns at >5% volatility
- **Reward Distribution**: Validate 10 tokens per quest completion
- **Penalty Application**: Confirm 20 tokens per failure penalty

#### Deterministic Behavior Tests
- **Reproducibility**: Same Bitcoin block hash produces identical results
- **I Ching Integration**: Verify 64 hexagram generation from block hashes
- **Evolution Triggers**: Test reputation threshold-based evolution
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Validate failure rate-based difficulty changes

#### Integration Tests
- **TAP Protocol**: Verify state transitions work with autonomous decisions
- **Trac Systems**: Confirm real-time metrics collection and response
- **Bitcoin L1**: Test block hash retrieval and processing
- **Story Engine**: Validate quest generation with autonomous difficulty
