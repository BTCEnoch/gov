│   └── build-wasm.sh           # WASM compilation (moved from scripts/)
├── governors/                   # Governor Angel system scripts
│   ├── batch_governor_quest_generator.py    # Quest generation (moved from root)
│   ├── governor_agent_prompt_generator.py   # AI prompt generation (moved from root)
│   ├── governor_ai_embodiment.py           # AI personality integration (moved from root)
│   ├── governor_interview_engine.py        # Interview system (moved from root)
│   └── governor_interview_integration.py   # Interview integration (moved from root)
├── lighthouse/                  # Lighthouse knowledge base scripts
│   ├── tradition_deduplication_script.py   # ✅ Completed cleanup (moved from lighthouse/)
│   ├── cleanup_redundant_files.py          # ✅ Completed cleanup (moved from lighthouse/)
│   └── cleanup_verification.py             # ✅ Completed verification (moved from lighthouse/)
└── setup/                       # System setup and initialization
    ├── setup_lighthouse.py                 # Lighthouse initialization (moved from root)
    └── setup_batch_ai_system.py           # AI system setup (moved from root)
```

### 2. Script Categorization ✅
