          "answer": "Pursuing sacred knowledge through selfish motivations triggers catastrophic hypertoken degradation, causing autonomous burn mechanisms that reduce metaphysical potency. Kabbalistic imbalances manifest as energetic blockages, where personal power-seeking creates recursive karmic traps that progressively limit mystical access. Hypertokens contaminated by egoic intentions experience dramatic rarity downgrades, effectively quarantining corrupted energetic signatures.",
