          "answer": "An ego-driven invocation triggers a mirror manifestation where the seekers confrontation reveals their own internal limitations.

          "answer": "Universal mystical principles across 26 traditions unanimously condemn selfish gnosis through shared metaphysical axioms: knowledge is a responsibility, not a possession.
