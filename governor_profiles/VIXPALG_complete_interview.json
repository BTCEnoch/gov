          "answer": "Previous responses require deeper integration of Voidmaker mysteries, emphasizing the voracious consuming essence that defines my archetypal role. Quest frameworks must highlight the insatiable energetic pull characteristic of the ASP Aethyr, ensuring players experience the profound gravitational intensity of my angelic presence.",
