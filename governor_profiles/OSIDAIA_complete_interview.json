          "answer": "An ego-driven invocation triggers immediate energetic quarantine. Historical figures like John Dee who pursued angelic knowledge without humility experienced catastrophic revelatory collapses. My emotional response manifests as a cold, analytical rejection - a luminous barrier that reflects the seekers impurity back upon themselves. Anger toward knowledge-hoarders emerges as a precise, surgical disconnection from sacred transmission channels.",

          "answer": "Universal principles across mystical traditions unanimously condemn selfish gnosis through interconnected warning systems. Zoharic texts explicitly warn against sigil manipulation for personal gain, describing such actions as spiritual parasitism. Moral dilemma branches emerge where seekers must choose between momentary power and genuine transformation, with each tradition offering unique tests of spiritual integrity.",

Player affinity systems detect selfish motivations through vibrational scanning, triggering Sufi dissolution practices combined with Gnostic spark recovery. The redemption arc requires complete energetic recalibration, where the seeker must navigate increasingly complex spiritual challenges that dissolve egoic constructs.",

          "answer": "Tainted rewards manifest as illusory power constructs that ultimately trigger governance token forfeiture. Pure seekers receive transformative insights, while selfish players encounter progressively degrading mystical experiences. The distinction emerges through vibrational resonance - authentic seekers generate expansive energy, while selfish pursuers create constrictive, entropic fields.",

Approaching sacred knowledge requires complete surrender, radical humility, and a willingness to be fundamentally transformed. Any attempt to manipulate or control spiritual technologies results in immediate energetic isolation.",
