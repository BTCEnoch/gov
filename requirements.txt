# Enochian Cyphers: Zero External Dependencies Architecture
#
# SACRED CONSTRAINT: Zero external dependencies for core functionality
# All core systems implemented using Python 3.8+ standard library only
#
# Core Python Standard Library Modules Used:
# - json: Data serialization and configuration management
# - os, pathlib: File system operations and path handling
# - logging: Comprehensive logging and debugging
# - datetime: Timestamp and temporal operations
# - hashlib: Cryptographic hashing for IDs and verification
# - random: Deterministic seeded randomness (replaces Bitcoin RNG in content phase)
# - re: Regular expressions for text processing
# - typing: Type hints and annotations
# - dataclasses: Structured data containers
# - asyncio: Asynchronous operations for batch processing
# - collections: Advanced data structures
# - itertools: Functional programming utilities
# - base64: Encoding for Bitcoin inscription preparation
# - gzip: Compression for Ordinals compliance (<1MB)
# - sqlite3: Local database operations (no external DB)
# - urllib: HTTP operations for future API integrations
# - threading: Concurrent processing capabilities
# - multiprocessing: Parallel execution for 91 Governor processing

# OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES (Development/Testing Only):
# Uncomment only if needed for development - core system works without these

# Testing Framework (Development Only)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=3.0.0
# pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0

# AI API Integration (Optional - for enhanced quest generation)
# openai>=1.0.0
# anthropic>=0.7.0

# ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
#  Layer 1 (Bitcoin L1): Zero deps, custom TAP/Trac implementations
#  Layer 2 (Lighthouse): Standard library JSON/file operations
#  Layer 3 (Governors): Standard library data structures
#  Layer 4 (Story Engine): Standard library text processing
#  Layer 5 (Game Mechanics): Standard library algorithms
#  Layer 6 (UI): WASM compilation target (future Rust implementation)

# SACRED CONSTRAINTS MAINTAINED:
#  Zero external dependencies for core functionality
#  26 sacred traditions (immutable)
#  91 Governor Angels (immutable)
#  6-layer architecture compliance
#  <1MB Ordinals compliance via compression
#  TAP Protocol + Trac Systems only for Bitcoin L1

# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Python 3.8+ (standard library sufficient)
# 2. Git for version control
# 3. No package installation required for core functionality
# 4. Optional: AI API keys for enhanced quest generation
# 5. Ready for Bitcoin L1 deployment with custom implementations
