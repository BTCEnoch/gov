    "opening": "In the sacred realm of {aethyr_name}, where the divine governors manifest their celestial wisdom, the seeker approaches the threshold of authentic Enochian practice. The ancient tablets reveal their secrets through the sacred language of the angels, as recorded in the spiritual diaries of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley.",
    "development": "Through the invocation of the sacred names and the contemplation of the Watchtowers, the practitioner enters into communion with Governor {governor_name}, whose domain encompasses {governor_domain}. The angelic presence manifests through authentic symbols and divine geometry, guiding the seeker toward true spiritual understanding.",
    "climax": "The moment of divine revelation arrives as the governor imparts their sacred wisdom through traditional Enochian methods. The seeker must demonstrate their understanding through authentic practice, proving their worthiness to receive the deeper mysteries of the {tradition_name} tradition.",
    "resolution": "Having proven their dedication to authentic practice, the seeker receives the governor's blessing and enhanced understanding. The sacred knowledge becomes integrated into their spiritual practice, opening new pathways for continued growth and enlightenment."
