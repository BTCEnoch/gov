    };
    
    engine.initialize(JSON.stringify(config));
    
    return engine;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Generate a Quest

```javascript
const questRequest = {
    player_id: "player_123",
    governor_id: 1, // ABRIOND
    player_context: {
        completed_quests: [],
        tradition_mastery: {
            "Enochian": 0.3,
            "Hermetic_Qabalah": 0.1
        },
        governor_relationships: {},
        current_energy: 25,
        sacred_items: [],
        aethyr_access: []
    },
    quest_seed: 12345,
    difficulty_preference: 2,
    tradition_focus: ["Enochian", "Hermetic_Qabalah"]
};

const questJson = engine.generate_quest(JSON.stringify(questRequest));
const quest = JSON.parse(questJson);

console.log(`Generated Quest: ${quest.title}`);
console.log(`Authenticity Score: ${quest.authenticity_score}`);
```

### Process Player Choice

```javascript
const choice = {
    action_type: "MakeChoice",
    quest_id: "quest_1_12345",
    choice_id: "choice_1",
    parameters: {
        tradition: "Enochian",
        governor_name: "ABRIOND"
    },
    authenticity_proof: "enochian_invocation_proof"
};

const transitionJson = engine.process_quest_choice(JSON.stringify(choice));
const transition = JSON.parse(transitionJson);

console.log(`State Transition: ${transition.transition_id}`);
```

### Validate Authenticity

```javascript
const content = "Sacred Enochian invocation through Governor ABRIOND's wisdom...";
const authenticityScore = engine.validate_authenticity(content);

console.log(`Authenticity Score: ${authenticityScore}`);
```
